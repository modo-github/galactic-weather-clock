 A clock showing the weather on a Pimoroni Galactic Unicorn

### What is it?

*This is a slimmed down version of RaphaÃ«l Velt's clock.
*I felt their version was a bit to busy. 
*Removed - birds, scrolling updates, hearts

*
*Added   - Feels like temprature, formatting of code



A Micropython script for Pimoroni's Galactic Unicorn [buy from Pimoroni shop](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/galactic-unicorn) that shows a clock as well as the current weather.

It uses the [Open Meteo API](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs) to retrieve the weather forecast as well as to adjust the time zone.
